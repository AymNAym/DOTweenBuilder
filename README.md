# DOTweenBuilder
A tool for the Unity DOTween API (by Demigiant), allowing you to easily create complex effects without coding anything.

## Description
Let's create interesting DOTween effects ! You can build all the available tweens and set the parameters as you like.
Everything takes place in a single Monobehaviour, directly in the inspector.
<br><br>
Almost every parameter has two ways to set its value : the first is the default way of setting a variable in the inspector. The second is through a dedicated ScriptableObject that will hold the value. For more information, see the dedicated section.
